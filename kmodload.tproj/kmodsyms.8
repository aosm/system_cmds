.Sh NAME
.Nm kmodsyms
.Nd creates a statically linked symbol file for remote debugging
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kmodsyms
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl k Ar kernelfile
.Op Fl d Ar dependencyfile
.Fl o Ar symbolfile
.Ar modulefile
.Nm kmodsyms
.Op Fl v
.Fl k Ar kernelfile
.Op Fl d Ar dependencyfile@address
.Fl o Ar symbolfile
.Ar modulefile@address
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
creates a statically linked symbol file for remote debugging using
.Ar modulefile[@address] .
If an address is specified for either the
.Ar modulefile
or
.Ar dependacyfile
they both must have the address tag. If addresses are specified it assumed that the command is being run on a different machine with a potentially different kernel, thus the
.Ar kernelfile
argument is also required.
If addresses are not specified they taken from the currently running host machine.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.It Fl k Ar kernelfile
Use alternate file
.Ar kernelfile
instead of default file /mach for linking
.Ar modulefile .
.It Fl d Ar dependacyfile[@address]
Add symbols from
.Ar dependacyfile
to kernel symbols prior to linking of
.Ar modulefile .
The file 
.Ar dependacyfile
must already be loaded.
.It Fl o Ar symbolfile
Creates file named
.Ar symbolfile
that contains statically linked output suitable to use with
.Xr gdb 1 
for remote debugging.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /modules -compact
.It Pa /System/Library/Extensions
directory containing loadable kernel modules.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a status of 0 on success. 
A status of 1 indicates a usage error.
A status of 2 indicates a indicates a permissions error.
A status of 3 indicates a problem with linking the module.
A status of 4 indicates a internal or system error.

.Xr kmodload 8 ,
.Xr kmodstat 8 ,
.Xr kmodunload 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command is based on the command kldload written by
