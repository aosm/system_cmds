.Sh NAME
.Nm kmodsyms
.Nd creates a statically-linked symbol file for remote debugging
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kmodsyms
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl k Ar kernel_file
.Op Fl d Ar dependency_file
.Fl o Ar symbol_file
.Ar module_file
.Nm kmodsyms
.Op Fl v
.Fl k Ar kernel_file
.Op Fl d Ar dependency_file@address
.Fl o Ar symbol_file
.Ar module_file@address
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm kmodsyms
is deprecated; use
.Xr kextload 8 ,
instead.
.Pp
The
.Nm kmodsyms
creates a statically-linked symbol file for remote debugging using
.Ar module_file[@address] .
If an address is specified for either the
.Ar module_file
or
.Ar dependency_file
they both must have the address tag.
If addresses are specified,
it is assumed that the command is being run on a different machine
with a potentially different kernel.
Thus, the
.Ar kernel_file
argument is also required.
If addresses are not specified,
they taken from the currently running host machine.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" ==========
.It Fl d Ar dependency_file[@address]
Add symbols from
.Ar dependency_file
to kernel symbols prior to linking of
.Ar module_file .
The file 
.Ar dependency_file
must already be loaded.
.\" ==========
.It Fl k Ar kernel_file
Use an alternate file
.Ar kernel_file ,
instead of the default file (/mach) for linking
.Ar module_file .
.\" ==========
.It Fl o Ar symbol_file
Creates file named
.Ar symbol_file
that contains statically linked output suitable
for remote debugging use with
.Xr gdb 1 .
.\" ==========
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /modules -compact
.It Pa /System/Library/Extensions
directory containing loadable kernel modules.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm kmodsyms
utility exits with a status of 0 on success. 
A status of 1 indicates a usage error.
A status of 2 indicates a indicates a permissions error.
A status of 3 indicates a problem with linking the module.
A status of 4 indicates a internal or system error.

.Xr kmodload 8 ,
.Xr kmodstat 8 ,
.Xr kmodunload 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm kmodsyms
command is based on the command kldload, written by
